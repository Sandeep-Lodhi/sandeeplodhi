ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm Sandeep Lodhi,

from Delhi, India â€” a city full of energy, culture, and innovation!

Iâ€™m a passionate and versatile Full Stack (MERN) Developer with around 3 years of hands-on experience in building robust, scalable, and user-friendly web applications. I love turning creative ideas into real-world digital solutions that make a difference.

Iâ€™m a self-motivated learner who enjoys exploring modern technologies, writing clean and efficient code, and continuously improving both my technical and problem-solving skills.

I specialize in crafting beautiful frontends using React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, and developing powerful backends with Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and MySQL. My goal is to deliver smooth, secure, and high-performing applications that bring real value to users and businesses alike.

Here are a few of the other activities that I love to do!
